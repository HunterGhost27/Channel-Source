# Channel Source

## Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

---

**_Channel Source_** adds new skills that allow the player to _regenerate_ **source** by expending **action-points**. This is different from other source-regen mods as these skills can be used in **combat**.

## About The Mod

The theme of **Source** is central to the story of **_Divinity Original Sin 2_** and yet the gameplay mechanics around the use of source are underwhelming in my opinion. Re-gaining source points is a pointless chore (and is not even a balance concern, as players can just teleport back and forth to a source fountain) and the game actively discourages you from keeping your SP count high, as a lot of bosses steal source and use OP skills against you.
This leads players to frontload their attack plan with source-skills and use them ASAP. Finding _puddles of source_ or eating a _source-orb_ do mitigate this problem a bit but are too rare to utilize consistently. I also find it hard to justify slotting 3SP skills, as they take up 3 Memory and become unusable as soon as you use a 1SP skill (which are some of the best source skills imo).
There are plenty of source regen mods out there that fix this by eliminating the need to go back to Miestr Siva's basement after every fight. I, however, feel that they don't make a tangible difference in gameplay, they just speed up the process. This mod not only allows you to regenerate source in combat, It was designed to _be_ used in combat.
Action Points are king in DOS2, and the most OP skills are those that allow you to gain more Action Points. This mod does the reverse, it allows you to convert Action points to Source points. You're free to regenerate outside of combat however much you want, but during combat, trading AP is a serious commitment.

## Features

- Adds 3 tiers of _Channel Source_ Skill that regenerates SP at the cost of AP.
- **_Channel Source_** - grants **1SP** at the cost of **2AP**.Can be found in **_Fort Joy_**.
- **_Channel Source, Greater_** - grants **2SP** at the cost of **3AP**. Can be found in **_Driftwood_**.
- **_Channel Source, Master_** - grants **3SP** at the cost of **4AP**. Can be found in the **_Nameless Isles_**.
- **_Siphon Source_** - allows you to transfer **1SP** to someone else. Think reverse source-vampirism. Can be found with _Channel Source, Greater_ - in **_Driftwood_**.
- Adds another skill similar in effect to the skills listed above, but much more powerful. I'll leave its location a secret.

**NOTE:** _Most of these skill-books should not be hard to find and you will come upon them naturally as you progress the storyline. Even the secret skill isn't exactly well hidden. The skill-books, except for the last skill, are not consumable. One is enough for the entire party._

- **_Mod-Menu_** can be accessed by combining any **channel-source skillbook** with an **identifying-glass**. If you have the [UI-Components-Library](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2337228868), you can access the mod-menu by right-clicking any CS-Skillbook and selecting the **Mod-Menu** context-menu option.

- The _Channel-Source_ skills have **Mutual-Cooldowns**. This means casting a channel-source skill will put all other channel-source skills on cooldown in-tandem. You can disable this feature and switch to individual cooldowns using the mod-menu. (Requires the Script-Extender).

## Locations
