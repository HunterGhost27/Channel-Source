# Channel Source for Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition

----------

***Channel Source*** adds new skills that allow the player to _regenerate_ **source** by expending **action-points**. This is different from other source-regen mods as these skills can be used in **combat**.

## Releases

* ***[Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2028696492)***

## Requirements

* ***[Script-Extender](https://github.com/Norbyte/ositools) is a soft-requirement. (May change in the future)***

## About The Mod

The theme of **Source** is central to the story of ***Divinity Original Sin 2*** and yet the gameplay mechanics around the use of source are underwhelming in my opinion. Re-gaining source points is a pointless chore (and is not even a balance concern, as players can just teleport back and forth to a source fountain) and the game actively discourages you from keeping your SP count high, as a lot of bosses steal source and use OP skills against you.
This leads players to frontload their attack plan with source-skills and use them ASAP. Finding *puddles of source* or eating a *source-orb* do mitigate this problem a bit but are too rare to utilize consistently. I also find it hard to justify slotting 3SP skills, as they take up 3 Memory and become unusable as soon as you use a 1SP skill (which are some of the best source skills imo).
There are plenty of source regen mods out there that fix this by eliminating the need to go back to Miestr Siva's basement after every fight. I, however, feel that they don't make a tangible difference in gameplay, they just speed up the process. This mod not only allows you to regenerate source in combat, It was designed to *be* used in combat.
Action Points are king in DOS2, and the most OP skills are those that allow you to gain more Action Points (break the Action Economy). This mod does the reverse, it allows you to convert Action points to Source points. You're free to regenerate outside of combat however much you want, but during combat, trading AP is a serious commitment.

As I said, these mechanics have split off a work-in-progress mod and were designed and built around a more fluid source-economy, where characters (and enemies) generate and expend source constantly. You may still find AP too valuable to spend on SP in the base game.

## Features

* Adds 3 tiers of *Channel Source* Skill that regenerates SP at the cost of AP.
* ***Channel Source*** - grants **1SP** at the cost of **2AP**.Can be found in ***Fort Joy***.
* ***Channel Source, Greater*** - grants **2SP** at the cost of **3AP**. Can be found in ***Driftwood***.
* ***Channel Source, Master*** - grants **3SP** at the cost of **4AP**. Can be found in the ***Nameless Isles***.
* ***Siphon Source*** - allows you to transfer **1SP** to someone else. Think reverse source-vampirism. Can be found with *Channel Source, Greater* - in ***Driftwood***.
* Adds another skill similar in effect to the skills listed above, but much more powerful. I'll leave its location a secret.

**NOTE:** *Most of these skill-books should not be hard to find and you will come upon them naturally as you progress the storyline. Even the secret skill isn't exactly well hidden. The skill-books, except for the last skill, are not consumable. One is enough for the entire party.*
[list]
* ***Mod-Menu*** can be accessed by combining any **channel-source skillbook** with an **identifying-glass**. It will allow you to acquire skill books you've missed, and toggle a script-based mode that should be compatible with mods like *Divinity Unleashed* (enabled by default if DU is detected). More features will be added to the Mod-Menu in time.
* Players will be presented with an **in-game changelog** if the mod *updates* mid-playthrough. To disseminate information and notify them about the changes. These items can be safely discarded/sold without consequence if you don't want to see them in your inventory. You can get them anytime from the mod-menu. I will add a toggle option for them in the mod-menu in the future.
