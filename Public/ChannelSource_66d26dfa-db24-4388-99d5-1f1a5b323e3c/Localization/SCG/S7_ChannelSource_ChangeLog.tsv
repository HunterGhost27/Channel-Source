S7_ChannelSource_Leaflet	Hello sourcerors,<br>The Channel-Source mod has been updated. As always, you can safely discard both this letter and the changelog if you do not wish to read them. You can also disable these notifications entirely using the mod-menu.<br>Now, I'd like to point out that the features of this update will only apply if the script-extender is installed. While the script-extender is not strictly required to use the most basic-features of this mod, I'd recommend installing it to access the more advanced functions like the ones added by this update. Starting with this update, casting any channel-source skill will put all other channel-source skills on cooldown aswell. This should (in most cases) prevent the player from using multiple channel-source skills in the same turn and incentivize using higher-tier channel-source skills first. This Mutual-Cooldowns feature is enabled by default but you can toggle this feature using the mod-menu and revert back at any time. The update also makes this mod ready to integrate with my next mod-project (when it launches). It will allow you to change the stat-attributes of these skills and customize the mod to your taste.<br>If you have any feedback, suggestion or ideas please let me know; and thank you for using my mods! <br><br>A Friend.	hc060190dg4bb4g4022g9a04g2c1dbae646d0
