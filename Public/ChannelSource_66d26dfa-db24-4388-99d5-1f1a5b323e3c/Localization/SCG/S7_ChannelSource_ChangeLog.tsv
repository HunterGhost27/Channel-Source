S7_ChannelSource_Leaflet	Hello sourcerors,<br>I am the author of the mod, Channel Source. I hope you are enjoying your playthrough of Divinity Original Sin 2.<br>You are getting this letter because Channel-Source was recently updated. It's difficult to reach all of you through steam, especially as you have no reason to return to the steam-page after you've hit subscribe. The best way to disseminate information then, in my opinion, is to pass it directly to the player, in-game. So moving forward, you will receive this and the "changelog" every time the mod updates. This way, you'll be notified when my mods update and see what changed without leaving Rivellon! You are, of course, free to ignore and discard both items should you wish.<br>Firstly, and most importantly, I would like to remind you that most mods are created by individuals like you and me, in their free time. As such, there is high-likelihood that mistakes fall through the cracks and weird unforeseeable events to occur. You are always advised to err on the side of caution and backup your saves. It's something you should always do, for any game, and for any mod. I will also advise keeping a backup of your mod-list. In case an update screws up, you can still continue playing with the old version. I extend this advice to official game patches/updates too, seeing as how buggy game-releases are these days.<br>Now, regarding this mod. This update brings in a bunch of backend infrastructure (that I'll no doubt use in all my mods going forward), some fixex, and a Mod-Menu (with cringy dialog).  I wished to squeeze in more but couldn't delay the update any further. You can access the mod-menu by combining any Channel-Source skill book with an Identifying-Glass. The menu, currently, lets you acquire the books that you missed during your journey, provide you with a new changelog and toggle the compatibility script for Divinity Unleashed. More stuff will be added to it as I feel the need. This update is practically a remaster, as, in addition to the new stuff, I secretly swap all skills and skill-books from your characters with new-ones (for better compatibility). The old recipes will continue to exist, for those who already have them in crafting-book, but I will remove all mention of them from the steam-page. They are now deprecated.<br> The mod already uses the script-extender if it's installed. However, it may become a hard-requirement in the future. Depending on what additional stuff is added to this mod. Since the mod didn't launch with any requirements (because I never intended to add much to it), I feel it is necessary to give you guys a heads-up. <br>I wish you people, the best of luck, in Rivellon, and in real life.<br><br>A Friend.	hc060190dg4bb4g4022g9a04g2c1dbae646d0
