S7_ChannelSource_Changelog	CHANGELOG<br><br>20th August 2020 - Channel Source skills now have mutual-cooldowns - using any one skill puts all of them on cooldown. Mutual Cooldowns are enabled by default but can be toggled-off using the mod-menu. (The mutual cooldown feature requires the script-extender). Created the Skill-Config-Menu that interfaces with my latest mod-project. The skill config menu will automatically become available for users when I release that mod.<br><br>14th May 2020 - Implemented Mod-Menu dialog. Renamed and swapped skills. Created a script to grant skillbooks that the player missed in their playthrough; recipes exist for back-compatibility. Implemented an in-game changelog and notification system. Full localization pass. Divinity Unleashed compatibility can now be toggled with the mod-menu, old database-toggle removed. Fixed CS-I skillbook being consumable.<br><br>10th April 2020 - Added Divinity Unleashed Compatibility Script. Assigned stats to the skillbooks (forgot to do this at launch).<br><br>20th March 2020 - Initial Release.	h2267df33g9020g4e45gaa2fgc2463109eb9f
S7_ChannelSource_Leaflet	Hello sourcerors,<br>This letter is to notify you that the Channel-Source mod has been updated. You can safely discard both this letter and the changelog if you do not wish to read them.<br>Now, before we begin, I'd like to point out that the features of this update will only apply if the script-extender is installed. The script-extender is not strictly required to use the most basic-features of this mod, however, I'd recommend installing it to access the more advanced functions like this one. With this update, casting any channel-source skill will put all other channel-source skills on cooldown aswell. Mutual-Cooldowns are enabled by default because I like this mechanic more :) . You can toggle this feature using the mod-menu and revert back at any time. The update also makes this mod ready to integrate with my next mod-project (when it launches). It will allow you to change the stat-attributes of these skills and customize the mod to your taste. <br><br>A Friend.	hc060190dg4bb4g4022g9a04g2c1dbae646d0
