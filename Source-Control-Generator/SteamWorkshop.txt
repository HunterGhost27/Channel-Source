[h1]Features[/h1]
[list]
[*]Adds 3 tiers of [i]Channel Source[/i] Skill that regenerates SP at the cost of AP.
[*][b][i]Channel Source[/i][/b] - grants [b]1SP[/b] at the cost of [b]2AP[/b].Can be found in [b][i]Fort Joy[/i][/b].

[*][b][i]Siphon Source[/i][/b] - allows you to transfer [b]1SP[/b] to someone else. Think reverse source-vampirism. Can be found with [i]Channel Source, Greater[/i] - in [b][i]Driftwood[/i][/b].
[*]Adds another skill similar in effect to the skills listed above, but much more powerful. I'll leave its location a secret.
[/list]
[b]NOTE:[/b] [i]Most of these skill-books should not be hard to find and you will come upon them naturally as you progress the storyline. Even the secret skill isn't exactly well hidden. The skill-books, except for the last skill, are not consumable. One is enough for the entire party.[/i]

[list]
[*][b][i]Mod-Menu[/i][/b] can be accessed by combining any [b]channel-source skillbook[/b] with an [b]identifying-glass[/b]. If you have the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2337228868]UI-Components-Library[/url], you can access the mod-menu by right-clicking any CS-Skillbook and selecting the [b]Mod-Menu[/b] context-menu option.

[*]The [i]Channel-Source[/i] skills have [b]Mutual-Cooldowns[/b]. This means casting a channel-source skill will put all other channel-source skills on cooldown in-tandem. You can disable this feature and switch to individual cooldowns using the mod-menu. (Requires the Script-Extender).
